ADDITIONAL NOTES: The First of July People's Commune of Quibao ì
comprised in 1982 about 200,000 people, divided over 11 ì
production brigades. There are 7 enterprises (small factories), ì
some related to the agricultural production of the commune, some ì
for building materials or cloth production (silk materials). The ì
total cultivated area is 1270 ha (19,000 mu), 40% of which is ì
used for the rice-wheat rotation, 40% for vegetables, 16% for ì
cotton and 4% for other uses (e.g. fish ponds). The main cropping ì
system is early rice - late rice - wheat/barley. Early rice is ì
planted late May and harvested early August. Late rice is from ì
early August to late October and wheat/barley is from November to ì
late May. Yields are: rice (both early and late) 11.5 ton/ha, ì
wheat/barley 4.4 ton/ha, cotton 0.9 ton/ha and rapeseed 1.7 ì
ton/ha; vegetables 82.5 ton/ha/year.
The following fertilizers are used for the rice-wheat cropping ì
system: N: ammoniumcarbonate, 2.25 ton/ha; K: KCl, 18.75 kg/ha; ì
P: superphosphate, 262.5 kg/ha. In addition organic manure and ì
straw is applied. For vegetables ammoniumphosphate is used as ì
fertilizer.
The commune has 200 pigs, ducks and chicken for organic manure ì
production and meat. There are waterbuffalos for cultivation ì
practices and, in addition, 300 sheep for milk. 
The main soil type in the commune is the waterlogged paddy soil, ì
according to the division in use in the Taihu Region. Other types ì
present are the percolating, submergic and gleyed paddy soils.

GROUNDWATER: 80 m deep in nearby well / LAND USE: local ì
information indicates that the anthropogenic soil layer of about ì
70 to 80 cm thickness results from 2000 years of manuring with a ì
mixture of loess with urine/dung (of cattle and man). This type ì

main crops: winter wheat, sowing in October and harvest in June; ì
maize, sowing after the wheat in June and harvested in the ì
beginning of October; cotton, rapeseed, soybean, Kao Liang, ì
sesame and barley are less important crops. Fertilized maize can ì
have a yield of more than 7500 kg/ha (100 jin/mu; 1 jin = 1/2 kg, ì
1 mu = 1/15 ha). / SOIL AND CROP MANAGEMENT: plowing is nowadays ì
mostly done by tractor (rented), but animal traction is still in ì
use. Weeding is done manually. Insecticides are used against ì
aphids, white spider etc. Irrigation is increasingly applied in ì
the area. Many small wells are made to depths of 80 to max. 200 ì
m. Most canals are earthen made. Some smaller structures (e.g. ì
tubes under the road) are made from cement. Water distribution ì
and application is judged by the farmer (in case of no rain, one ì
irrigates once every 15 to 20 days for maize). Since a few years ì
the communal and production brigade system has been abandoned and ì
replaced by an individual small farming system.","10/11/94 00:00:00",

Very deep, well drained, reddish brown sandy clay loam derived ì
from granite. Soil structure is only weakly expressed. It is ì
highly porous and well rooted, shows a strong biological activity ì
and contains in the deeper subsoil weathered granite fragments.

LAND USE AND VEGETATION: original vegetation is a deciduous ì
tropical forest. Before 1963 secondary forest, in 1963 planting ì
of rubber trees. Tree distance 6 x 3 meter. Fertilizer use: Urea ì
and phosphorus. Yield is about 3 ton/ha/year.
GENERAL SOIL INFORMATION: Soil map 1:500.000 indicates that CN017 ì
is located in the largest map unit, i.e. Latosol derived from ì
granite. This soil type covers the largest part of Hainan Island. ì
Granite is the dominant parent rock of Hainan island. Field ì
observations show that besides this reddish brown clayey soil, ì
other variants exist. The soil varies from reddish brown clay to ì
light greyish sandy loam/loamy sand. The greyish colour is caused ì
by groundwater influence but probably also induced by a coarser, ì
more acid granite type resulting in a sandy soil. No detailed ì
maps were made available, but field observations in a transect ì
from west to east show that both soil types appear to be ì
representative for large areas.
The soil is formed in an erosion terrace in granite. The altitude ì
of the terrace is around 150 meter. The landscape has a ì
plain-like appearance and consists of low, broad interfluves ì
(hills). CN017 is located on an upper slope position of a broad, ì
low hill, being representative for the larger part of the hill. ì
On the lower slope, transitional to the valley, soil colours ì
become more yellow and the subsoil strongly mottled.
The soil has a high biological activity. Pores and cavities are ì
made by termites (dominant), ants and worms. Spherical termite ì
cavities occur having a diameter of about 5 to 6 cm and flat ì
floors, with or without fungus gardens. Their density about 2/m2.
Penetrometer readings in moist B-horizon, about 4 kg/cm2.

Very deep, well drained, reddish brown to red clay derived from ì
Quaternary clay. The topsoil is nearly structureless. The upper ì
subsoil has a subangular blocky structure while the deeper ì
subsoil has an angular blocky structure and is strongly mottled. ì
The soil is compact, there are mainly micro pores and few very ì
fine to fine pores. Soil permeability is judged to be reduced, ì
especially in the strongly mottled deeper subsoil, where ped ì
surfaces are covered by clay cutans and which shows very few ì
pores.
The soil surface is smooth and has a thin seal. Especially on ì
eroded bare soil surfaces a bio-seal may be formed, reducing even ì
more the infiltration capacity of the topsoil for rain.

GENERAL LANDFORM: the intermontane basins in Southern China are ì
known as 'Red Basins'. At Yingtan the width of the basin is about ì
30 km. The basin has a plain appearance and consists of nearly ì
level to undulating interfluves (low broad hills) with broad, ì
nearly level valleys / LAND USE AND VEGETATION: the Red ì
Quaternary Clay soils of the interfluves are not used for ì
cultivation by the farmer. Present vegetation is sparse grass ì
cover and Masson Pine planted about 15 years ago. Growth is slow ì
(height about 4 meters and diameter 8 cm) / SLOPE PROCESSES: the ì
Red Quaternary Clay soil interfluves (hills) are affected by ì
erosion. This is caused by the high run-off, resulting in sheet ì
erosion. On middle and lower slopes, run-off water concentrates ì
and severe gully erosion may occur. Erosion is man-induced, ì
because the original broad-leaved forest has been cleared long ì
ago. Before the use of inorganic fertilizers, the grass/herb ì
vegetation with some topsoil was removed for the fertilization of ì
the paddy fields in the valley. At present this practice is not ì
used anymore, however, the litter is still frequently collected ì
by farmers for kitchen fuel. This still reduces the vegetation ì
cover, incorporation of organic matter in the topsoil and ì
bio-activity and therefore still enhances the run-off and ì
erosion.","02/15/96 00:00:00",

mottling results from a past period with different climatic ì
conditions or is caused by actual processes.

GROUNDWATER: Groundwater observations throughout the year are ì
necessary to verify the assumed stagnating of water in the deeper ì
subsoil. Probably the sandstone and the strongly mottled deeper ì

Brief soil description:
Moderately deep, imperfectly drained very dark gray clay soil, ì
having a black topsoil. The soil has a poor structure (coarse blocky and primatic) and is ì
very hard when dry. The underlying ignimbrite is penetrated by tree ì
roots through a few cracks till probably great depth.

The underlying ignimbrite is slowly permeable for water. However ì
fragments emersed in water, absorb water easily. The ignimbrite has about ì
 10 % available water capacity. When penetrated by roots the ignimbrite may contribute to the moisture supply for trees.

The thickness of the solum varies considerably at short distance, ì
it varies from about 20 till 70cm [estimated from a few ì
observations]. Rock and ignimbrite outcrops are observed at a distance ì
of a few 100 meters.

Parent material is early Pleistocene ignimbrite of the Bacaces ì
Formation. It seems likely that the soil has received volcanic ì
ash additions.
Concretions in the Bg horizon are composed of iron & manganese.

Brief soil description:
Very deep, well drained, darkbrown clay soil with a very thick A horizon. 

Parent material of the subsoil > 75 cm is probably derived from the underlying andesitic rock. The thick A horizon was derived or influenced by ì
volcanic ashes. However, the first 35cm of the topsoil is strongly deviating from the buried A horizon, the latter having ì

Physiographical unit: the profile is located in a 400 m wide, ì

water course is present in the valley / Parent material: ì
colluvial materials from the slopes and also other materials ì

Surface characteristics: few limestone gravels are on the ì
ploughed surface / Soil aggradation: slight water deposition / ì
Human influence: ploughing.

Vegetation and land use: the area has been subjected to ì
cultivation for a very long period of time. According to Bolos ì
(1958) the climax vegetation is Violo-Quercetum valentinae ì
alliance Quercion pubescenti-petraedae with oak (Quercus faginea ì
subsp. valentina) being the dominant tree at the heights above ì
600 m, below that Quercetum rotundifoliae alliance Quercion ì
ilicis is the climax with holm-oak (Quercus ilex subsp. ì
rotundifolia) as the main tree. When the vegetation is removed ì
the maquis develops with Quercus coccifera as a main bush. The ì
oak can be found also at heights well below 600 m, on the N and W ì
facing slopes. Only on the shallowest soils or on the steepest ì
slopes forest existed until recent years (two or three decades ì
ago), but now it is under rapid regression and the land is been ì
used for cereals. The agriculture was of Mediterranean type, with ì
olives, vineyards and winter cereals (barley and wheat). Now, the ì
social changes, the use of heavy machinery and the market prices ì
have put almost all the area under winter or spring cereals ì
cultivation.

Drainage: the drainage is through two permanent streams: the Sio ì
River and the Llobregos River. The former flows in the south and ì
the latter in the north through an anticline core. The small ì
tributaries carry water only after the storms. The lowest parts ì
of the cuesta consists in many cases on dry minor valleys, where ì
no stream exists and where only in the very large storms water ì
flows through. Calvet and Gallart (1979) concluded that the ì
valleys and drainage system is inherited from past geological ì
times.

A very deep, well drained, brown, loamy soil. A dark brown clay loam (A-horizon) is from 52 cm onwards underlain by a dark reddish silt loam and a silty clay loam. The B3-horizon continues below a depth of 150 cm, colouring reddish brown to yellowish red in the lower part, with a texture of a silty clay. The bulk of the roots is confined to the top 70 cm; moderate to coarse subangular blocky structure is common in the B-horizon. The pH is slightly acid in the upper part of the solum and medium acid in the B3. The top-horizon (0), from 1 to 0 cm consists of partly decomposed organic material.

Soils of this kind were encountered in the Upper Crate basin, are however not neccessarily restricted to this region. Precise distribution patterns are not known. These soils are associated with rankers and redder Mediterranean soils. The soils differs from reddish brown soils, developed under similar environment, in lacking an argillic horizon and having a low base saturation percentage. The pH is determined conform Hellige.

A very deep, moderately well drained, dark red, clayey profile. The A-horizon dark reddish brown to yellowish red sandy clay oerlies a deep homogeneous B2t-horizon of textural clay; throughout this horizon are Mn-mottles prominent. The bulk of roots is confined to the topmost horizon. The pH (method Hellige) is mildly alkiline in the topsoil and neutral in the subsoil. No evidence of groundwater is found within 300 cm.

This type of soil is generally underlain  by wheathered fine gravel or clayey texture and massive structure. Continuous clay cutans are common, and generally the clay content increases with depth (average 56%). These soils occurs frequently on remnants of marine terraces at intermediate altitude (90 to 120 m), often situated on interfluves. Under a mediterranean climate the soils support a natural vegetation of oak forest, often degenerated to low shrub.
The soil is encountered in Calabria, but is believed to occur commonly in the mediterranean region, although individual bodies of the soil are supposedly not very large.
An appreciable acreage of this soil is in use for cereal production. Associated soils are red and reddish brown soils, classified as Ultic Rhodustalfs, because of the redder colour in the B-horizon, as well as rankers and alluvial soils.

Topography and landform: The area has an almost flat topography, ì
the slope gradient increasing to the North and East to gently ì
undulating, thus inducing a N-NE aspect of land. Situated on a ì
broad interfluve at an altitude of 1700 m the landform is ì
characteristic for a large area East of the Rift Valley, which ì
has been named ""broad ridge topography"" by Scott (1963), or as ì
""volcanic ridge landscape"". The ridge on which NAL is located is ì
bordered to the South by the valley of the upper Nairobi river, ì
which flows from West to East and to the North by a canalized ì
stream following the same direction. Both streams contribute to ì
the Athi river.

Vegetation and land use: The original vegetation of bushed and ì
wooded grassland with characteristically broad-leaved trees such ì
as Combretum and Croton macrostachys with mostly evergreen shrubs ì
made way a long time ago for arable cropping and exotic tree and ì
bush species. Present cropping experiments on the station include ì
plants like maize, sunflower, pulses, tomatoes, irish potatoes ì
and flowers. Prior to these coffee (Arabica) was grown. These and ì
other crop trials may have influenced the fertility status of the ì
(top)soils.

Brief description of the profile: The typical soil at the NAL is ì
described as well-drained, very deep, dark reddish brown to dark ì
red, friable clay.

Additional notes on profile description:
Ah: in the upper 5 cm weak sealing occurs;
AB: also many fine and few medium pores.

In a thin section taken from the Bt2 at 110-120 cm micro-cutans ì
are obseved and occasionally clay filling occur. There is also ì
common soil fauna activity mainly by termites and millipeds, as ì
evident from channels and aggrotubules. Rooting is very deep, the ì
bulk of roots is concentrated in the top 60 cm.

1921-1962 and 1965.","02/18/96 00:00:00",

is powdery. Porosity is difficult to assess, infact a high micro ì
porosity is present. Effective soil depth is probably limited by ì
platy structure of the subsoil. Texture is probably silt (the ì

ferro-oxyde mottling is not fossile but caused by stagnant ì
water,the soil will classify as an aquic torriorthent.

Brief profile description: 
Brown, sandy soil with laterite concretions in lower layers, overlaying gravelly, multicoloured clayey material and weathered rock.
Parent material: Sandy slope colluvium, containing lateritic gravels in lower part, overlaying very gravelly and very concretionary old colluvium and overlying weathered banded gneiss.

Polygenetic soil: buried Bt horizon is most probably genetically not related to overlaying horizons. This assumption seems most plausible, since equivalent Apumo soils can be found without a buried B horizon being present.
Horizon BC1: scattered Fe/Mn concretions
Horizon 2C: subrounded quartz gravels mainly less than 1cm diameter and rounded hard laterite concretions with brown and black surface colours.
Horizon 2Btb: gravel is mainly fine subrounded quartz and laterite concretions; locally larger angular quartz pieces from a broken quartz vein in the underlaying horizon; less lateratie concretions in lower part of horizon.
Horizon 3C: weathered micaceous schist and banded gneiss with mainly intact rock structure, many weathered yellow (10YR 7/6) feldspar fragments, many fine mica flakes (muscovite)
Imperfectly drained; rapid permeability in sandy material, but impedence on the lower, clayey layers.

Very deep, well drained, yellowish brown loamy sand. A thin dark ì
A horizon  is followed by a weakly mottled transition horizon, ì
from about 50 cm starts a very uniform soil colour.
The weak mottling in the Ah2 and BA horizons consists of ì
yellowish/red mottles caused by iron ('root rust') and black ì
because of organic matter in bio-channels. The weak yellowish/red ì
colours are indicative for temporarely saturation of the soil by ì
excessive rain water.
The top horizon, Ah1, can be divided in two thin horizons: 0-4 cm ì
with a dark colour and 4-8 cm with a bleached colour. The Bw1 ì
horizon is a bit darker than the overlaying BA horizon.
The soil site is located in the upper slope of a convex hill. The ì
soil parent material belongs to an old alluvium, the 'Iquitos ì

320 cm starts abruptly an older clay alluvium formation, probably ì

According to the FAO classification there is no ferralic ì
B-horizon because of a too high silt/clay ratio, and no argic ì
B-horizon because the rate of clay increase is just not ì

A clayey over clayey loamy textured, dark reddish brown and dark reddish gray profile, that shows its partly colluvial origin through many continuous pressure faces on ped faces in the topsoil. It is mildly alkaline in the upper 30 cm and moderately below. Skeletal components - soft shale and sandstone fragments - are increasing with depth. Many very fine, common fine and a few medium to coarse pores appear in the horizons 1-3, only common very fine pores below. Clay cutans are abundant as continuous to broken throughout the profile even as patchy in the upper top of the A horizon. In horizons 1-3 the structure is quite differentiated, but mostly subangular blocky and falls apart into smaller peds. Downwards the structure becomes massive with exception of horizon 5 (fine to very fine subangular blocky), which has also a slightly different parent material.

MICRORELIEF: shallow furrows and low ridges occur locally, caused most probably by ploughing. CRACKING: cracks about 1 cm wide and 20 cm deep (may be as deep as 40 cm). 

FLOODING: by rain and river water, for 7 to 8 months of the year.

VEGETATION AND LAND USE: Palynological data of subsoil samples ì
from two sides in the tidal marshes, viz. east of Pathum Thani ì
and southeast of Ayutthaya, indicate that at the time of ì
deposition the vegetation in these marshes consisted dominantly ì
of mangrove species (69-93%), mainly Rhizophoraceae (Pons and Van ì
der Kevie, 1969), with a subordinate amount of various ferns and ì
grasses. As the influence of the tides lessened, the mangrove ì
forest gave initially way to a fresh water forest (Van der Kevie, ì
1971). This gradually changed to a vegetation of mainly tall ì
grasses, rushes and sedges, which form the present day natural ì
vegetation of the Bangkok Plain (Van Bremen, 1976). Clearing of ì
the natural vegetation commenced about a century ago because of a ì
growing demand for rice. At present management practices include ì
ploughing (water buffalo or tractor), :incidental application of ì
fertilizers, and burning of the straw. Most of the area is now ì
under cultivation (floating rice). Average rice yield is 1000 ì
kg/ha.

MORPHOLOGY:
Ah  In lower part of horizon the structure is thick platy. 
C   Also continuous thick clay cutans and very few medium hard
    angular gypsum nodules observed.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION:
A deep, fine textured and poorly drained soil, with clear horizon ì
differentiation, partly due to the textural change from the loamy ì
topsoil to the clay subsoil. The soil is relatively low in ì
organic matter (the amount of which decreases gradually with ì
depth) while the pH increases from strong (5,5) in the topsoil to ì
slight acidity (6,4). Mottiling mainly occurs in the topsoil (A ì
and E horizons) and in the upper part of the B horizon. ì
Iron-mangenese nodules occur throughout the profile (frequency ì
increases with dept) down to the B3 horizon, below which only ì
very few nodules occur.

Chloris pychinothrix, Sporobolus pyramidalis, and Bothriochloa    ì

crops are grown in the Farm trials.  During the wet summer ì
season, maize, sunflower, soyabeans, groundnuts, sorghum, pearl ì
and finger millets, potatoes, summer wheat, pulses, bambara ì
nuts and cowpeas.  During the dry winter season, winter wheat, ì
winter barley and potatoes are grown. (4)There is evidence of ì
termite activity, particularly in the upper horizons (0-30 cms).  ì
Covered channels, constructed by the insects since the pit was ì
dug, extend down to 150 cms. A number of termite and ant fungal ì
gardens were observed in the field examinations, and one large ì
termite garden was collected for display purposes. (5)Common,  ì
small, white fungal colonies occur in the first horizon (0-27 cms).   ì
Two areas of expanding mycelia developed on the pit face at about  ì
100 cms depth. (6)Many mites were observed on the profile face.   ì
In addition to these and the termites, colonies of small black ants  ì
and centipede insects were observed. (7)Field texturing reveals a ì
somewhat inactive clay fraction. The presence of sand grains in ì
the texturing was also observed - fine in the upper horizons, ì
medium-sized in the middle horizons, and with coarse grains in ì
the lower horizons.  Texturing also reveals the evidence of water ì
stable aggregates.  The amount of these aggregates appears to ì
decrease with depth from 27 - 160 cms. (8)Very rare fragments of ì
weathered gabbro in the soil profile, which were generally ì
yellowish brown/black/whitish in colour and between 3 - 5 mm. in ì
size. (9)One small, (230 mm) subrounded boulder of gabbro was extracted ì
from the pit. A skin of weathered gabbro surrounded the extracted ì
core. (10)Very fine pores (<1 mm) were observed from 49 cms to ì
depth. Some of these pores were caused by roots, which had sinceì
decomposed. (11)Slight colour variegations were noted from 47 cms ì
to depth but were difficult to code. (12)Water permeability into ì
peds of the upper horizons (0 - 27 cms) was slower than those of ì
lower horizons, presumeably because of the presence of organic ì
matter in the topsoils. (13)Iron/manganese stains were observable ì
from 23 cms, became more numerous with depth, but also less ì
prominent. (14)Under virgin conditions, the site would normally ì
be located under Brachystegia spiciformis/Julbernardia globiflora ì
woodland. These species, along with Uapaca kirkiana, Acacia sp. ì
and Erithrina sp., presently occur in an undisturbed area of the ì
adjacent Royal Harare Golf Course.  Occasional large Brachystegia  ì
trees occur within the grounds of the Experimental Farm, one of which ì
is 30 m from the pit. (15)Examination of the soil profile reveals ì
the presence of shiny ped surfaces, which are recorded in the ì

plain covering a very wide expanse of country.  The excessive     ì
erosion that has occured since the Pliocene movements can be      ì
attributed to constantly-repeated sheet floods, which are some-   ì
times recorded in the present day.  The general landsurface rises ì
from 470 m near Beitbridge to about 700 m at its northernmost     ì
extent.  (5) Concentrations of common, subrounded quartz stones of  ì
coarse gravel to small stone size were observed at the bottom ì

Henderson Research Station.  The relative position of the site on  ì
the landscape slope has been assessed as a lowerslope position.  ì
The semi-natural grass cover does not include sedge varieties, ì
which are found lower down the slope.  (2) The grass vegetation ì
is dominantly Hyperrhenia sp.  (3) Cattle have been excluded from ì
the Block for a period, so a good stand of grass remains.  (4) ì
The dominant landform of the area is described as low-lying ì
pediments between the Iron Mask Range in the west and the Blue ì
Granite Hills in the east.  The Iron Mask Range runs in an ì
approximately NE to SW direction, and in the southwest, consists ì
of a single, narrow range with steep sides and a very narrow ì
summit from 1550 to 1640 metres in height.  In between the two ì
ranges of hills, flows the Dasura River.  The granite hills in ì
the east are of rugged and broken aspect, rise up to 1560 metres ì
in height, and are typically ""castle kopje"" country with the ì
occasional dome-shaped hill.  (5) Lister indicates that the area ì
occurs on the Post African Erosion Surface.  (6) The geology of ì
the area is very mixed, but in general, the soils around the site ì
of the profile can be said to be derived from in-situ sediments ì
of the Iron Mask Series and fine-grained quartzo-felspathic meta ì
volcanics.  These parent materials contain a high proportion of ì
silt-sized particles.  (7) The grass vegetation and root patterns ì
successfully stabilize the surface layers of the profile.  If ì
this protection were removed, the surface horizons would be very ì
prone to capping, sealing and hardsetting.  (8) The area around ì
the profile shows evidence of old cattle track lines, which are ì
orientated downslope towards lower drainage lines or depressions. ì
(9) The profile horizons show much evidence for high watertables. ì
In the uppermost horizons, root channel staining can be observed. ì
With depth, increasing concentrations of mottles and iron/mangan  ì
ese concretions are observed.  (10) The uppermost horizon of the ì
profile, from 0 to 2 cms, is composed of moderately decomposed ì
organic matter, derived from grasses.  (11) Grass roots are ì
evident throughout the profile, and are found both within peds ì
and around peds.  Dead roots within peds leave noticeable black ì
discolorations.  (12) The seventh horizon was not sampled for ì
analysis, as it contained significant amounts of concretionary ì
and stony material.  (13) Under normal seasons, a higher moisture ì
or watertable might be expected, given the low-lying position of ì

Brachystegia spiciformis      ì
and Julbernardia globiflora trees and shrubs dominate, but there ì
are common Terminalia sericea and Parinari curatellifolia trees ì
and shrubs.  A detailed listing of natural vegetation types is    ì
available.  (2) Only a few grasses and arable weeds were observed  ì
in the immediate vicinity of the pit. (3) The land has been cleared  ì
and stumped to accomodate the ICRAF Agroforestry Trials.  The upper  ì
part of the Block where the pit is sited was cleared in 1990.      ì
Agroforestry shrubs were planted in December 1990.  The land was   ì
ploughed at the time of establishment.  At the time of planting,   ì
all agroforestry shrubs were watered every 2 weeks with 10 litres  ì
of water for a two-month period.  Thereafter, no water beyond the  ì
annual rainfall was applied. During the 1990/91 season, 251 mms of       ì
rainfall were received, but during the 1991/92 season, only       ì
151 mms were received.  No pretreatments or fertilisations have ì
taken place.  In contrast to the ICRAF Trials at Domboshawa, each ì
shrub was surrounded with a low depression well.  Plantings        ì
occur about 5 metres from the pit.  (4) A variety of agroforestry  ì
species have been planted in blocks.  They include Acacia augustisma,  ì
Calliandra calliothrus, Flemingia conjesta, Gliditsia triacant,    ì
Grincidia sepium, Sesbania sesban, Leucaena leucocephala, Cajanus  ì
cajan and Flemingia macrophila.  (5) Occasional, broad, round termite  ì
mounds occur within the Block, about 80-100 metres apart and up to  ì
2 metres in height.  These mounds would normally support tree and/or  ì
shrub growth, but this vegetation cover has been removed.  (6) The  ì
location of the pit relative to the landscape is difficult to assess.  ì
It occupies a crestal, but midslope position on a long, gradually ì
sloping (<2%), west-facing and convex spur of ground that lies ì
between two drainage lines.  The slope in the immediate vicinity ì
of the pit is flat.  (7) Lister (1986, p99) indicates that the ì
dominant landform of the area consists of regularly jointed ì
granite koppies with intermediate flat pediments.  (8) This ì
particular pit is very slightly higher (50 cms) in position than ì
ZW12, but about 6 metres higher than ZW13.  (9) The soil ì
horizonation is very variable within the pit.  On the sampled and ì
described face, the dense gravel horizon occurs at about 100 cms ì
from the surface, and is underlain by heavily mottled red/yellow   ì
plinthic material, which sets hard on exposure.  On the other ì
side of the pit, the dense gravel horizon tapers down to 200 cms ì
from the surface, and above it is a moist, heavily mottled sand, ì
which is not as strongly mottled as the plinthite.  (10) Roots ì
observed in the profile are mostly tree roots of varying ì
dimensions.  (11) Mottle concentrations vary from about 2% in the ì
second horizon, 5% in the third to 10% in the fourth.  The ì
concentrations of mottles in the fifth and sixth horizons is ì
difficult to determine.  The seventh horizon is dominantly ì
mottled.  (12) Mottle colours in the fifth, sixth and seventh ì
horizons also include 7.5YR hues, depending on the presence or ì
absence of Fe/Mn concentrations.  (13) Fe/Mn concretions dominate ì
the fifth and sixth horizons, but are concentrated particularly ì
in the upper part of the fifth horizon.  The concretions are ì
intimately mixed with quartz gravels and stones.  The size and ì
concentrations of both Fe/Mn concretions and quartz stones ì
diminishes into the sixth horizon.  (14) Some Fe/Mn conretions ì
occur in the seventh horizon, but most are Fe/Mn segregations ì
rather than concretions.  (15) Clay coatings can be visibly ì
observed around the concretionary and stoney material of the ì
fifth and sixth horizons.  (16) Rare, fine, vertical cracks occur ì
from the second horizon to depth.","02/15/96 00:00:00",

identification.  (2) Only a few grasses and arable weeds were ì
observed in the immediate vicinity of the pit.  (3) The land has ì
been cleared and stumped, to accomodate the ICRAF Agroforestry ì
Trial Block.  The upper part of the Block, on the edge of which ì
the pit is situated, was cleared in 1990.  The land was ploughed ì
and agroforestry shrubs were planted in December 1990.  At the ì
time of planting, each shrub received 10 litres of water every ì
two weeks for a two-month period.  Thereafter, no water was ì
applied and the shrubs had to rely on the seasonal rainfall, ì
falling during the months of November to April.  During the ì
1990/91 season, 251 mms of rainfall were received.  During the ì
1991/92 season, only 151 mms were recorded.  No pretreatments or ì
fertilizers have been applied to the shrubs.  However, in ì
contrast to the shrubs planted at the ICRAF site at Domboshawa, ì
each shrub station has been surrounded by a shallow well ì
depression to conserve the limited seasonal precipitation.  ì
Planting occur with a few metres of the pit.  (4) A variety of ì
agroforestry shrubs have been planted.  These include Acacia ì
augustisma, Calliandra calliothrus, Flemingia congesta, Flemingia ì
macrophila, Gliditsia triacant, Grincidia sepium, Sesbania ì
sesban, Leucaena leucocephala and Cajanua cajan.  (5) ì
Occoasional, broad, round termite mounds occur within the Block, ì
about 80-100 metres apart and up to 2 metres in height.  These ì
mounds would normally support tree and/or shrub growth, but this ì
vegetation has been removed.  (6) The location of the pit on the ì
landscape is somewhat complex.  It is slightly lower (50cms) than ì
ZW11 and occurs on the break-of-slope in a midslope position on a ì
long, gradually sloping (<2%), west-facing, convex, interfluve ì
lying between two drainage lines to the north and south.  The ì
slope in the immediate vicinity of the pit is flat, but falls ì
away within 4 metres.  (7) Lister (1986, p99) indicates that the ì
dominant landform of the area consists of regularly jointed granite ì
koppies with intermediate flat pediments.  This particular area ì
falls within the pediment definition.  The Erosion Surface of the ì
area is Post-African.  (8) Horizon differentiation within the ì
sandy overburden is difficult to assign.  Likewise, the two lower ì
sixth and seventh horizons are split horizons  (9) A rather ì
curious phenomenon was observed when scraping the exposed surface ì
of the upper horizons.  In the first, second and third horizons, ì
and to a lesser extent in the fourth and fifth horizons, very ì
fine, light coloured strands of material could be observed ì
between sand grains and possibly contributing to stabilising the ì
loosely held grains.  This material could be remnants of organic ì
material/roots.  (10) The first horizon is a mixture of ì
organic-rich material and lighter coloured sandy material. ì
(11) Assigning a Munsell colour to the light coloured sandy ì
horizons was not easy, and the 10YR choice is probably a ì
compromise.  (12) The pit was located about 30 metres from ZW11, ì
but exhibited no lateritic concretionary material.  Mottles were ì
present in lower subsoils, but colours were noticeably redder.  ì
(13) Rare, very fine, vertical cracks were observed from the ì
fifth horizon to depth.",,

grassland.  The medium-sized trees and shrubs are both deciduous ì
and semi-deciduous, and the grasses are a mixture of annual and ì
perennial species.  Brachystegia and Julbernardia species no ì
longer dominate the tree/shrub mix whilst Terminalia sericea ì
trees and shrubs are more evident.  Vegetation samples were ì
collected from the immediate vicinity outside the perimeter fence ì
of the Block, and await full identification.  (2) Only a few ì
living grasses and arable weeds were observed close to the pit, ì
but there was ample evidence of tussocky grass rooted clods, ì
indicating high moisture conditions (vlei) during the wet season. ì
(3) The land had been cleared of its trees and grasses during ì
1991 to accomodate the ICRAF Trial Block, and ploughed.  Agroforestry ì
shrubs have not yet been planted in this lower portion of the Block.  ì
(4) Occasional, broad, round termite mounds occur further upslope of ì
the pit.  One smaller termite mound close to the pit had been broken ì
down and locally distributed during the ploughing process.        ì
(5) The pit occupies a lowerslope position on the northern side ì
of the long, gradually sloping (<2%), west-facing interfluve.  The ì
northern drainage line is approximately 70 metres away.  The 2% ì
slope in the vicinity of the pit is concave, and drops away ì
towards the subdued drainage line.  (6) Lister (1986, p99) ì
defines the dominant landform of the area as regularly jointed ì
granite koppies with intermediate flat pediments.  This ì
particular area falls within the pediment definition.  The ì
Erosion Surface is Post-African.  (7) No surface stones occur ì
near the pit.  However, occasional, low, granite outcrops occur ì
at the soil surface, about 30 metres from the pit, and become ì
more evident towards the drainage line.  The pit is underlain by ì
hard, slightly weathered rock.  (8) This pit is about 6 metres ì
lower than the upland ZW11 and ZW12 profiles.  (9) Horizon ì
selections are based on the following attributes.  The first ì
horizon is an organic-rich, ploughed topsoil; the second, ì
disturbed, less organic-rich horizon, with termite channels which ì
have become infilled with dark topsoil material; the third, less ì
organic-rich and with fewer infilled termite channels; the ì
fourth, a lighter, brown horizon with occasional, infilled ì
termite channels; the fifth, a coarser grained sandy horizon with ì
occasional, infilled termite channels; the sixth, a densely ì
packed horizon of predominantly medium, hard, yellowish brown ì
concretions; the seventh, a sandy horizon with many fine quartz ì
gravels and occasional concretions; the eighth, fewer quartz ì
gravels and occasional, large mottles; the ninth, strongly ì
weathered, moderately hard, granitic parent material; onto hard ì
rock at the base of the pit.  (10) The assignment of pore ì
distributions proved to be difficult.  There is probably an ì
increase in pore abundance from the third to the fifth horizons.  ì
Pores were observed in the sixth, and also include the larger ì
voids between concretions.  Pores in the seventh and eighth ì
horizons appear larger, but are very variable in the ninth ì
horizon.  (11) Slight colour variegations were observed in the ì
fourth horizon.  No mottles were observed in the fifth horizon, ì
so these variegations are probably not due to hydromorphic ì
conditions.  (12) Roots are rather conspicuous by their absence, ì
particularly in lower horizons, although relic evidence of them ì
can be found within the darkened and infilled termite channels.  ì
(13) There were no vertical cracks observed within the pit.       ì
(14) No cutans could be observed.  (15) The seventh, eighth and ì
ninth horizons were moist.  (16) Evidence of historic termite ì
activity could be observed in all horizons, although apparently ì
diminishing with depth.",,
