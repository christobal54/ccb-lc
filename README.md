# Install

## iPython defaults

If you're interested in using the ccb default `ipython` profile, which contains a few plotting defaults, you can set an environment variable to do this for you. From the base `ccb-lc` directory, run the following:

```bash
conda activate ccblc
conda env config vars set IPYTHONDIR=$PWD/ipython
```
